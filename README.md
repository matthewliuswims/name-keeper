### Outstanding Issues
0.01) add placeholder text in groupscreen when there are no users 'no people! click + below to add some.'
0.02) in sketch just add a completely different edit user screen...but should be very similar to just the create user screen
1) still need to fix jest...
2) need to fix ref warnings in AddUserScreen - I just don't understand them
3) what if the groupname and username are super long?
4) why doesn't the date of android work?
5) try a bunch of users and a bunch of groups
6) see if https://native.directory/stars/popup-menu works well
