### Outstanding Issues
0.01) add placeholder text in user screen when there are no users 'Add a person below to this group - CLICK below' also add place holder text for groups screen, explaining how app works. Something like: `Write the name of people you just met - but first, create a group!'

1) still need to fix jest...
2) in the overflow section, have a help screen.
2) need to fix ref warnings in AddUserScreen - I just don't understand them
3) what if the groupname and username are super long?
5) try a bunch of users and a bunch of groups
6) see if https://native.directory/stars/popup-menu works well
7) don't have to import styles if I'm not overriding anything?
8) change package versions from latest to numbers
9) design decision for groupName.. was bad
